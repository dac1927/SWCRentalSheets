## How to create sheet
Make a copy of this [Demo Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aCLgKzn3c1kc_lLb4aoxDrGMwyWGG4-88-tAvaLwpHY/edit?usp=sharing).
Under "Rental Tools" select "Hard Reset", then authorize the script to run (on the "This app isn't verified" page click advanced, then "go to Rental Script", then click "allow").
There you go, you have a working sheet!
## How to set up sheet
If you want to be able to stay up do date with this repo, you'll need to use clasp to clone the script. In the spreadsheet, go to the dropdown Tools -> Script Editor. In a new directory clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/dac1927/SWCRentalSheets.git`. In the Script editor, go to Project Properites and copy the value next to Script ID. Then in the same directory where you ran git clone, run `clasp clone <Script ID>`
